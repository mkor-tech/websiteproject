                <p>You are wanting to set up as a consultant. To prove your knowledge you want to start by creating a blog talking about yourself, why you are interested in technology and demonstrate how much you know. For each of the sections below asking you to describe, include around a paragraph of information about the topic. 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board. 1.4Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.– How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</p>

                    <p>IT plays an essential role in today's modern business, from how people communicate using VoIP phone, email and instant messaging to inventory and stock control.</p>
                    <p>Almost all business information documentation is now digitally stored either in the cloud or on a server. Complex IT systems can now track sales, manage expenses and maintain customer relationships.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Successful projects are usually well managed projects. Most development teams work collaboratively using code management tools such as git and gitHub and Trello.
                        It is not only the code that needs to be managed but also the developers writing it.</p>
                        
                        <p>A successful project usually has a capable project manager, who can:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visualise and Communicate all Project Deliverables and Activities</li>
                            <li>Complete Deliverables Step-by-Step.</li>
                        <Ul>
                        <p>The tools needed to complete a project successfully are good project management software such as Trello and a good coding editor such as Visual Studio Code, that aids in rapid and semantic code writing.</p>
                        <p>A method is also needed for a team to check code amendments in and out (versioning) without overwriting what has already been written. The industry standard to achieve this is git/gitHub.</p>

                        <p>Firstly I would map out the site structure. This would include the number of pages, site navigation, image and text block areas, the creation of text (copy) and consider any front end interaction that may require coding.</p>
                        <p>These development blocks can be mapped out into tasks using a Trello board.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Common why digital projects may fail are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>The initial scope was poorly defined (and the initial strategy / vision was unclear)</li>
                        <li>Trying to do too much work all at once</li>
                        <li>Lack of leadership - for any project to work, it needs strong leadership from the top down.</li>
                        <li>Insufficient communication - someone on the tech team needs to be able to explain the project details regularly to the “non-tech” executives and other involved parties.</li>
                        <li>Lack of leadership - for any project to work, it needs strong leadership from the top down.</li>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The first thing to do is to determine what the job requires - what function does it have to fulfill. Decisions have to be made not only on current project requirements but also future requirements. Does remote working have to be factored in. If so then there may have to be a central server of some sorts with versioning software. The dev team will also have to communicate and collaborate with each other. This can be done using applications such as Slack and Trello. It is also probably a good idea to standardise all software (including code editor/s) for the entire team. Extensive online research can often determine the most appropriate software and hardware.</p>

                        <p>Visual Studio Code - Visual Studio Code has in-built hints and help aids (intellisense).</p>

                        <p>It also has:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Code-completion and syntax highlighting.</li>
                            <li>Errors and Warning output</li>
                            <li>Bracket matching</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>GitHub - Version control is a type of system that allows you to keep track of changes made to your code over time.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can revert back to specific ‘versions’ of your code</li>
                            <li>Collaboration on the same work is possible because specific changes and associated contributors are tracked</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Trello is a digital version of a whiteboard or post-it note task listing system. Probably the simplest application of the Kanban method would be splitting a large task list into three stages or phases, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To Do</li>
                            <li>In Progress</li>
                            <li>Done</li>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The regulation has a number of aims all designed to increase and standardise the protection of individuals including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Data portability - The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.</li>
                        <li>The right to be forgotten - The GDPR introduces a right for individuals to have personal data erased. The right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’.</li>
                        <li>The right to prevent profiling - The GDPR gives people the right not to be subject to solely automated decisions, including profiling, which have a legal or similarly significant effect on them.</li>
                        <li>The right to object to processing - Individuals have an absolute right to stop their data being used for direct marketing.</li>
                        <li>The right to rectification and erasure - The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have inaccurate personal data rectified, or completed if it is incomplete.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Data protection is about ensuring people can trust you to use their data fairly and responsibly. This might be anyone, including a customer, client, employee, partner, member, supporter, business contact, public official or member of the public.</p>
