                    <div class="panel">
                <p>In planning and building my website I was happy to use both Visual Studio code and Trello.
                    Visual Studio Code has everything I need out of the box to code HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There was no need for additional configuration or to install additional plugins.
                    Trello has many time saving features
                    </p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion"><h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                <p>Both Visual Studio Pro and Trello were appropriate for the task. Visual Studio Pro nicely handled both markup and code and its code completion was a time saver. Using Trello I was able to plan out and tick off tasks using its Kanban approach to task management

                <button class="accordion"><h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The strengths of my website include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The visual impact of a 100% full width header image. </li>
                            <li>The navbar highlights the current page.</li>
                            <li>Text and paragraphs are well spaced and the text is large enough to be readable.</li>
                            <li>I’m happy with the overall look and feel of my website, but on reflection there are a few things I would have done differently.</li>
                            <li>Using a collapsible accordion to display the questions and answers, initially looked like a good presentation solution, but it may have been simpler and cleaner to use headings as navigational hashtags.</li>
                            <p>My sites weaknesses:</p>
                            <li>I could have also put greater emphasis on making the navigation bar more responsive.</li>
                            <li>My CSS could have been organised in a more orderly fashion.</li>
                    </ul>

                <button class="accordion"><h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your projec</h3></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Further improvement that can be made are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>A contact form - A contact form allowing individuals to interact and comment upon my sites content.</li>
                        <li>Social media links - Social media links allowing individuals to ‘connect’ and share views.</li>
                        <li>More colour - Possibly colour headings and tonal backgrounds.</li>
                        <li>More images - A selection of images which correspond to the narrative of the site - this will also make it visually more interesting.</li>
                    </ul>   
                </div>

                <button class="accordion"><h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3></button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>All links have been checked and work correctly. There are no dead links on any of the pages. All images have been checked and work correctly. There are no broken images, and all images work correctly.</p>
                        <p>All site content was typed out using Google Docs, therefore further processing was required in order to turn the text into formatted HTML. On reflection if I had planned my time out better using Trello I could have developed the content better. Sometimes it is easy to forget about actual content during development.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion"><h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3></button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Tools such as Trello are great for project management, but only if you are disciplined enough to abide by the Kanban rules that you have set for yourself.</p>
                    <p>I could have structured my time more efficiently. One of the main drawbacks is that I  spent too much time on site design and gave not enough consideration to the actual content.</p>
                    <p>Working in teams would have made project management easier. The project could then be split up into code, HTML structure and front end design. The tasks could then be delegated to the appropriate team member.</p>
                </div>

            <button class="accordion"><h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3></button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Productivity and efficiency can be improved by using a combination of  time management  and version control when working within teams. Task delegation also helps production. If each member of a team knows exactly what is expected and by when, then tasks get completed on time.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>To improve my own efficiency I would first look at better self management, by breaking down the various blocks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, content creation) into manageable components. I would then give timescales for completion.</p>
            <p>If timescales start to slip then I would look at team collaboration. I would use Slack, Trello and github in order to control team development.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion"><h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>I would break down the site or app into frontend and backend testing. The back end (code) I would first check for errors using a code editor.I would apply  breakpoints and console log messages and check console output for errors. For the front end I would use usability testing, combined with performance and security testing.</p>
